# ML-based web application for predicting Bank customer Churn
## Description
The central idea of this project is to develop a web application that collects input from the user and
can show the probability of churn for the data given by the user as an input. This project has been done with
the motive of developing the same for Indian banking organizations, with which any banking firm can predict
the churn of its customers with ease. Since there is no proper past data regarding the customers in India
acquired, this project takes data from the banks located in countries like Germany, Spain, and France, and the
same idea can be implemented in the future for Indian banking organizations. Behind this application, there
has been a trained neural network model deployed, with which the application is capable of delivering accurate
results. Moreover, the application is designed in such a way to display an interactive dashboard for the user,
from which he/she can infer insights from the visualizations and can compare themselves with the past data.
To train a machine learning model to predict the churn of the customer by taking several features into
consideration.
• To prepare the data for analysis – it includes data pre-processing, data cleaning etc.
• To provide insights on the data through Exploratory Data Analysis.
• To create a Web Application, which has a trained model in its back end and could deliver results on
the data given by a user
